## **Garry Tan's Dos for Startup Founders**

1. **Focus on "Making Something People Want":** Garry Tan emphasizes that Y Combinator's guiding mission is to help founders create products that address real needs. This means founders should prioritize building solutions that genuinely solve user problems rather than chasing trends or mimicking competitors.

2. **Authenticity & First Principles Thinking:** Tan encourages founders to start from personal experience and insight, using first principles thinking to develop unique, original solutions. He advises founders to avoid simply copying existing ideas and instead dig deep into why things work and how they can be improved.

3. **Rapid and Continuous Iteration:** Success requires adopting an agile mindset and responding quickly to customer feedback. Tan stresses the importance of fast experimentation and product iteration to reach product-market fit efficiently.

4. **Embrace Conflict and Seek Personal Growth:** Founders should not shy away from difficult conversations—conflict management is essential for leadership and decision-making. Tan also advocates for personal development, including therapy, to build resilience and self-awareness.

5. **Community and Mentorship:** Building a strong network is crucial—YC places heavy emphasis on the founder community. Advice and support from experienced mentors and peers can help avoid common mistakes and accelerate learning.

6. **Be Earnest, Not Just Bold:** Y Combinator looks for genuine, earnest founders over flashy résumés or pitches. Being sincere and committed deeply to your mission is more critical than trying to impress.

7. **Mission-Driven Approach:** Startups should be driven by a clear purpose and values, which guide decision-making and help attract the right talent and partners.

## **Garry Tan's Don'ts for Startup Founders**

1. **Don't Get Distracted by Hype or Status:** Avoid chasing what's popular or trying to emulate "unicorn" companies for the sake of it. Instead, focus on building value for real customers and the long-term health of your business.

2. **Don't Avoid Difficult Decisions:** Tan notes that some founders make the mistake of deferring tough choices or shying away from conflict, which can harm company culture and progress. Face challenges head-on and prioritize clear communication.

3. **Don't Overcomplicate:** Many founders fall into the trap of over-engineering their products or business models before reaching product-market fit. Start simple, test, and iterate.

4. **Don't Ignore the Importance of Mental Health:** Neglecting personal well-being can lead to burnout or poor leadership. Founders, Tan argues, should invest in themselves as much as their products.

5. **Don't Focus on Vanity Metrics:** Focus on actionable data that drives real business growth and customer retention, rather than metrics that look good on paper but don't translate to value.
