## **Sam Altman's Dos for Startup Founders**

1. **Make Something People Want:** The foundation of all great startups is a product that truly excites and solves real problems for users. If people enthusiastically recommend your product to others, you're on the right track.

2. **Focus Relentlessly:** Dedicate yourself to building the product, talking to users, and assembling a great team. Avoid getting sidetracked by superficial activities like conferences, fancy events, or endless meetings.

3. **Build a World-Class Team:** Great companies need both exceptional co-founders and hires. Look for optimistic, action-oriented, problem-solvers who are committed to your mission. Hire slow, fire fast. Value aptitude and commitment over experience.

4. **Pursue a Bold, Clear Vision:** Set an easy-to-understand vision and mission for the company. This helps attract talent, investors, and keeps the team motivated. Your vision should be ambitious, but grounded in reality.

5. **Stay Frugal and Resourceful:** Use resources wisely and keep costs low, especially salaries. Momentum and longevity depend on financial discipline.

6. **Find Product-Market Fit:** Growth solves almost all problems. Focus ruthlessly on achieving product-market fit, and only scale once you've found it.

7. **Maintain Momentum:** Move fast, avoid bureaucracy, and celebrate small wins. Speed is a startup's key advantage over bigger competitors.

8. **Embody Obsession and Resilience:** Founders need an exceptional level of dedication and intensity. Starting a company is demanding and often unpleasant. Make sure you're in it for the long haul—Altman suggests a ten-year commitment mindset.

## **Sam Altman's Don'ts for Startup Founders**

1. **Don't Chase "Fake Trends":** Avoid building on hype with no substance. Prioritize real market shifts supported by actual adoption and measurable impact over trends that are superficially popular.

2. **Don't Get Distracted:** Distractions come in many forms—networking, seeking advice, focusing on PR rather than product, etc. After YC, it's easy to lose focus. Grinding away on fundamentals is usually what leads to success.

3. **Don't Over-complicate:** Keep things flat and simple organizationally. Don't try to do too many things or add unnecessary complexity. Simplicity reduces mistakes and increases focus.

4. **Don't Outsource the Hard Work:** You cannot successfully delegate core company-building tasks to others, especially in the early stages. Founders must stay hands-on with product, hiring, and execution.

5. **Don't Forget to Make Money:** Growth and vision are important, but the business model needs to be viable. Don't overlook the fundamentals of revenue and sustainability.

## **Bonus Traits Altman Highlights for Successful Founders**

- **Clarity:** Be able to explain what your company does in a single sentence.
- **Resilience:** Most startups fail, and the process will be unpleasant; founders must persist through adversity.
