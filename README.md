## Paul Graham

### Product & Users

**DO**: "Make something users really love"

**DO**: "What I tell founders is not to sweat the business model too much at first. The most important task at first is to build something people want"

**DO**: "It's better to make a few people really happy than to make a lot of people semi-happy"

### Growth & Startups

**INSIGHT**: "Growth drives everything in this world"

**INSIGHT**: "Running a start-up is like being punched in the face repeatedly, but working for a large company is like being water-boarded"

**INSIGHT**: "As long as you're over a certain threshold of intelligence, what matters most is determination"

### Ideas

**DON'T**: "The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas"

**DO**: "Instead of trying to make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your brain into the type that has startup ideas unconsciously"

---

## Garry Tan

### Product

**DO**: "Make something people want"

**DO**: "Make something a lot of people want a lot"

**INSIGHT**: "Good design is not picking colors and making it pretty. Good design is removing steps, understanding motivations, making it clearer, more navigable, faster, easier"

### Execution

**DO**: "When you're starting something new, the whole advantage is that you're a real human being"

**INSIGHT**: "A 10% difference in retention is actually the difference between a startup that's flatlining and one that's working"

**DON'T**: "Avoiding conflict killed my startup. I thought being 'easygoing' made me a good leader. In reality, I was bottling up problems until they exploded"

### Ideas

**INSIGHT**: "If you're a startup and your main competitor is apathy, then you're not solving a big enough problem"

**DO**: "Customers are not your mama— they won't love you unconditionally. To get them to switch, you still have to be 10X better, not 10% better"

---

## Michael Seibel

### Launching

**DO**: "Launch something bad quickly"

**DO**: "Launching a mediocre product as soon as possible, and then talking to customers and iterating, is much better than waiting to build the 'perfect' product"

### Customers

**DO**: "A small group of customers who love you is better than a large group who kind of like you"

**DO**: "Recruiting 10 customers who have a burning problem is much better than 1000 customers who have a passing annoyance"

### Execution

**INSIGHT**: "Ideas are irrelevant. You are judged on execution, and the number 1 way to prove that you can execute is by executing"

**DO**: "How do I get 90% of what I want with only 10% of work?"

### Product-Market Fit

**INSIGHT**: "The vast majority of founders, the vast majority of YC founders even, never find product/market fit ever"

---

## Sam Altman

### Focus

**DO**: "Write code, talk to users, and build the company. Most other things that founders do are a waste of time"

**DO**: "Set a clear, easy-to-understand vision for your company, and make it be a mission people believe in"

**DO**: "It's much better to first make a product a small number of users love than a product that a large number of users like"

### Execution

**DO**: "It's better to make a decision and be wrong than to equivocate"

**DO**: "Just ask them or just do it"

### Teams

**INSIGHT**: "Cofounder relationships are among the most important in the entire company. The number one cause of early death for startups is cofounder blowups"

**DO**: "Are they smart? Do they get things done? Do I want to spend a lot of time around them?"

### Success

**INSIGHT**: "To have a successful startup, you need: a great idea (including a great market), a great team, a great product, and great execution"

**INSIGHT**: "Focus is a force multiplier on work"

---

## Brian Chesky (Airbnb)

### Product & Vision

**DO**: "Why does your company deserve to exist? Because if I don't do it, no one else will"

**DO**: "It's better to have 100 people love you than to have 1,000,000 people like you"

**DO**: "We start with the perfect experience and then work backward. That's how we're going to continue to be successful"

### Ideas

**DO**: "If we tried to think of a good idea, we wouldn't have been able to think of a good idea at all. You just have to have a solution for a problem in your own life"

### Culture

**INSIGHT**: "Brand is really the connection between you and your customers—if you have a very strong culture, then the brand will come through"

### Hiring

**DO**: "You gotta build a team that is so talented that they almost make you slightly uncomfortable because they know by being with them you're going to have to raise your game"

### Early Days

**DO**: "I interviewed the first 300 employees at Airbnb"

### Passion

**INSIGHT**: "You have to have a deep reservoir of passion. I had a deep conviction Airbnb would work"

---

## Drew Houston (Dropbox)

### Learning

**DON'T**: "Don't stress so much about trying to get ready. The best training for being a founder or CEO is being a founder or CEO"

**DO**: "It's like learning to ride a bike. You can't be discouraged and stop when you get scraped up — and then it becomes super easy later on"

### Mindset

**INSIGHT**: "A lot of times it's an asset to not know everything about everything. Fortunately, the Dropbox founders are too stupid to know everyone's already tried this"

### Failure

**DON'T**: "Don't worry about failure; you only have to be right once"

### Execution

**DO**: "It's much better to be right than to be consistent. You have to be flexible"

### Simplicity

**DO**: "We've found it's a lot more effective to find one hook that people can easily understand. That gets people in the door"

---

## Patrick Collison (Stripe)

### Product-Market Fit

**DO**: "Pre product-market fit metrics are actually relatively unhelpful and you should bias very strongly towards kind of as much inspection and high throughput qualitative feedback as possible"

### Hiring

**INSIGHT**: "The things that counterfactually really mattered are hires"

### Culture

**INSIGHT**: "Culture is dynamic and subject to revision"

### Mindset

**INSIGHT**: "When creating something, you have to be very optimistic, because if you weren't optimistic, you wouldn't bother doing it, but you also have to be very pessimistic, because there are tons of problems"

### Execution

**DO**: "It's much better to be right than to be consistent. As long as you get into that mindset, I think a lot of the actual errors themselves are recoverable"

---

## Justin Kan (Twitch)

### Product vs Distribution

**INSIGHT**: "1st-time founders are obsessed with product, 2nd-time founders are obsessed with distribution"

### Mental Health

**DON'T**: "No amount of achievement or success or material possessions will create happiness. To tie your ego's wellness to achievement is an unhealthy linkage"

### Pivoting

**DO**: "We didn't invent anything new. We just focused on doing one thing really well"

### Culture

**DO**: "The key is to build a culture where people are communicating and working together from a place of empathy"

### Product-Market Fit

**INSIGHT**: "When you achieve product-market fit like that, it compounds on itself"

### Flexibility

**DO**: "If you view your product too rigidly, you can fail. With Twitch we tried lifecasting, but became a gaming culture platform. You have to be flexible"
