## **Michael Seibel's Dos for Startup Founders**

1. **Launch Fast and Iterate:** Don't wait to build the "perfect" product. Launch with a basic version that offers real utility, get feedback from real users, and repeatedly improve. Early traction and learning come from actual user engagement, not internal speculation.

2. **Solve Real, Frequent Problems:** Build something that fixes pain points people face daily or weekly. If you're trying to convince users they have a problem, it's likely not urgent enough to build a business around.

3. **Build With Engineers:** A technical founding team moves faster and learns more deeply. At least half of the co-founders should be able to build the product directly. Outsourcing slows learning and execution.

4. **Do Things That Don't Scale:** Don't rush to automate or scale in the early days. Manual onboarding, direct customer work, and hands-on problem-solving help you deeply understand users' needs (e.g., Airbnb's founders personally photographing rental units).

5. **Focus on Execution:** Shipping product and quickly responding to feedback beats endless planning or hype. YC invests in teams that can build fast, adapt, and solve real problems – not just in exciting ideas.

6. **Stay Lean:** Conserve money. Most startups fail because they run out of money, not because of bad ideas. Every dollar should directly move the product or customers forward.

7. **Pick the Right Team:** YC looks for 2-4 full-time co-founders, preferably technical, with at least 12 months of financial runway. No side hustles or half-commitments.

## **Michael Seibel's Don'ts for Startup Founders**

1. **Don't Wait for Perfection:** Waiting too long to launch wastes precious time and stalls learning. "Perfect" is not realistic early; speed is far more valuable.

2. **Don't Scale Prematurely:** Automating or building complex infrastructure too soon leads to wasted effort. First, understand what makes users love the product, then scale.

3. **Don't Chase Distractions:** Avoid time sinks like endless conferences, flashy networking, talking to corporate development teams or reporters, and obsessing over pitch decks.

4. **Don't Build the Wrong Team:** Solo founders, non-technical founding teams, or part-time founders almost never get funded and rarely succeed long-term.

5. **Don't Neglect Customer Conversations:** Product development done in isolation typically fails. Constant direct engagement with users drives successful iteration and feature selection.

6. **Don't Underestimate Execution:** Passion and ideas are common; teams that ship and adjust rapidly are rare, and they win.
