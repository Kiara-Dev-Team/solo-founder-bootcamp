## **Paul Graham's Dos for Startup Founders**

1. **Solve Real Problems:** The best startup ideas stem from problems you personally experience. Graham advocates for "organic ideas"—solutions that emerge naturally from your own life or frustrations, rather than whiteboard brainstorming sessions. Airbnb, for example, started by solving conference housing shortages.

2. **Build Something Small to Start:** "Start small," Graham advises. If you make a small number of users love your product, you're off to a great start. Initial simplicity allows you to iterate fast and learn from real feedback.

3. **Do Things That Don't Scale:** Early on, be willing to do manual, laborious work (customer outreach, personal support, hand-holding) to get traction. Don't worry about scalability until there's real demand for your product. This creates the momentum necessary for growth.

4. **Follow Your Curiosity:** Genuine intellectual curiosity leads to domain expertise—a key ingredient for startup success. Find a field you're obsessed with, and become an expert before seeking to build a company in it.

5. **Move Quickly and Iterate:** Speed is essential. Launch a basic version rapidly and improve it driven by user feedback. Graham notes, "A startup is a company designed to grow fast."

6. **Assemble Complementary Co-founders:** Having co-founders with diverse but aligned skillsets is vital. Choose people you trust and with whom you share a vision; disputes between founders can destroy startups.

7. **Be Relentlessly Resourceful:** Budget leanly and strive for "ramen profitability" (operate so frugally that you could survive just eating ramen noodles). Every dollar should be dedicated to learning or growth.

8. **Listen to User Feedback, Always:** Commit to continuous improvement—respond obsessively to what early users say, fix bugs, and ship updates often.

## **Paul Graham's Don'ts for Startup Founders**

1. **Don't Chase Ambitious-Sounding but Impractical Ideas:** Avoid ideas that are innovative for their own sake but not useful to real customers. Focus on practicality and real impact over novelty.

2. **Don't Wait for the Perfect Idea or Launch:** Don't get bogged down aiming for perfection; launch early and learn quickly from real users. Perfection delays progress.

3. **Don't Trust Your Instincts Unthinkingly:** Startups are counterintuitive. Graham warns that trusting your first instincts can lead to mistakes; learn from the community, iterate, and be open to correction.

4. **Don't Over-Optimize for Investors or Networking Too Soon:** Focus first on building something people actually want, not on impressive-sounding pitch decks or networking events. True opportunities and investment come from traction.

5. **Don't Ignore Founder Disputes:** Unresolved disputes kill startups more often than product failures do. Establish vesting schedules and exit plans early on.

## **Paul Graham's Core Philosophy**

Paul Graham's most repeated advice: **"Make something people want"**—and do so by being curious, building for yourself first, moving fast, listening to users, and not worrying about scaling or impressing others early on.

**Key Principles:**
- **Organic Ideas:** Build from personal experience and genuine need
- **Ramen Profitability:** Stay lean and focused on learning
- **User Obsession:** Listen obsessively to early users
- **Speed:** Launch early and iterate based on feedback
- **Relentless Resourcefulness:** Do whatever it takes to succeed

Avoid distractions, perfectionism, and impractical ambitions. Success is grounded in genuine expertise, relentless execution, and a willingness to problem-solve unglamorously at the start.
