## Common Mistakes

### Application Mistakes

**1. Unclear Description**
- Being too vague about what you do
- Using buzzwords instead of clear language
- Not explaining the problem well

**2. Weak Evidence**
- No traction or proof points
- Vague metrics or claims
- Not showing real user feedback

**3. Team Issues**
- Missing co-founder context
- Unclear equity split
- No evidence of ability to execute

**4. Poor Video**
- Reading from a script
- Inaudible audio
- Too long or too short
- Not showing all founders

### Interview Mistakes

**1. Not Knowing Numbers**
```
Partner: "What's your revenue?"
You: "Um, I'm not sure exactly... maybe around..."

❌ This is a red flag. Know your metrics!
```

**2. Being Too Defensive**
```
Partner: "Why would anyone use this?"
You: "That's a great question and you clearly don't understand..."

❌ Don't be defensive. Listen and respond thoughtfully.
```

**3. Long Answers**
```
Partner: "What do you do?"
You: "Well, it all started when I was working at..."

❌ Get to the point quickly. You have 10 minutes.
```

**4. Not Listening**
```
Partner: "How do you make money?"
You: "Our growth strategy is..."

❌ Answer the question asked. Don't pivot to what you want to say.
```

### Strategy Mistakes

**Waiting Too Long to Apply**
- Apply early, even if you're not "ready"
- Getting rejected is fine - you can reapply
- The application process itself is valuable

**Overthinking the Application**
- Don't spend months perfecting it
- Clear and honest > polished and vague
- Launch your product instead of endlessly refining your app

**Applying Without a Co-founder**
- YC strongly prefers teams
- Solo founders have much lower acceptance rates
- Find a co-founder before applying
